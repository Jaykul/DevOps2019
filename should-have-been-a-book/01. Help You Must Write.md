# Let's start with Help

For a good command, we really require just three things in the help:

1. A Synopsis

    A short description of the command is mandatory for the help system to even engage.

2. An example -- for each parameter set

    In the simplest case, you can simply provide a single example with no parameters, and explain that this runs it with the defaults -- document in the example what happens in that case.

    If you can't think of an example for a parameter set -- consider removing that parameter set ðŸ˜‰.

    Make sure you have at least one example for each parameter set that _correctly_ shows an example of how to provide the values which are necessary to invoke that parameter set.

    More examples are better, but only if they have significantly different _outcomes_.

3. Documentation of every parameter

   You can write this as you add parameters, by simply putting a comment above each one. I strongly recommend you do it that way (rather than use the `.PARAMETER` marker) because it simplifies it, making it _harder to mess up_, and _harder to forget_ to update.


# We're going to skip right over testing

That's a whole different talk. If you're not writing tests, I strongly recommend you start using Pester, write acceptance tests at a minumum --have a look at Gherkin syntax-- and read a little about behavior-driven development.
