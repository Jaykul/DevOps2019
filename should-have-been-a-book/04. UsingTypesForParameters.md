## How can we validate input values?

The first way you can validate input is to specify a type. Ideally, simple types like `[int]` or `[string]` or built-in types like `System.IO.FileInfo`.

The second way you can validate input is to add validation attributes. There are several built in, and even more in PowerShell 6: ValidateCount, ValidateDrive, ValidateLength, ValidateNotNullOrEmpty, ValidatePattern (note there's now an error message property), ValidateRange, ValidateSet, and more, including of course, ValidateScript -- for all your other needs.

The third way is to create your own types and even argument transformation attributes and type converters. This gives you a lot of flexibility and limitless ability to check property values as they're being set on the object -- to enforce your rules before the objects are even passed to the function. Argument transformation attributes can let you convert parameters from one type to another, and even prompt the user for more information, etc.

## Output types and promises

When you write a function, you should always decorate it with an `[OutputType()]` attribute indicating the type(s) of the objects it may output. This lights up tab-expansion in other commands in the pipeline, and can help tools tell you which commands work together.
