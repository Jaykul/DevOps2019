# When you can't handle an error

Obviously in PowerShell it's relatively acceptable to let errors flow from your output, but some times you absolutely _have_ to handle them, suppress them, turn them into warnings, or convert terminating exceptions into non-terminating errors.

The simple story for error-handling is that you should always make sure that anything which could be thrown is caught and thrown. We could get into this a lot more (talking about why sometimes ErrorActionPreference can cause exceptions to not be thrown until there's a `try/catch` wrapped around them), but the simple thing is to just follow a pattern:

Wrap each script block in a try/catch and re-throw:

```PowerShell

function Test-Function {
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param()
    begin {
        try {

        } catch { throw $_ }
    }
    process {
        try {

        } catch { throw $_ }
    }
    end {
        try {

        } catch { throw $_ }
    }

}
```

Once you've done that, you should, of course ...

## Handle the errors you can handle

Add additional `catch` statements to handle the exceptions you want to handle.

Add logging to get your exception messages, stack trace, etc.
