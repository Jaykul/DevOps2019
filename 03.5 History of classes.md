## A History Lesson of Custom Classes in PowerShell

### Prior to PowerShell 3

PowerShell's Extensible Type System didn't originally let you create new concrete types. If you wanted an actual type that you can cast to or type-check with, as in your example script ... you needed to define it in a compiled language (C# or VB.net).

In PowerShell 2, you could use the "Add-Type" command to compile the code in-line, but the definition still had to be in one of those languages:

```PowerShell
Add-Type @"
    public struct contact {
       public string First;
       public string Last;
       public string Phone;
    }
    "@
```

In PowerShell 1, you would have had to manually use CodeDom, there is a very old function [new-struct](http://poshcode.org/scripts/190) script on PoshCode.org which will help. Our example becomes:

```PowerShell
    New-Struct Contact @{
        First=[string];
        Last=[string];
        Phone=[string];
    }
```

### In PowerShell 3

In PowerShell 3, we got the ability to use the `PSCustomObject` accelerator to add a (fake) type name, and an attribute we could use on parameters to test for it, so that this:

```PowerShell
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        PSTypeName = "Contact"
        First = $First
        Last = $Last
        Phone = $Phone
    }
```

Could be sort-of required by this:

```PowerShell
    function PrintContact
    {
        param( [PSTypeName("Contact")]$contact )
        "Customer Name is " + $contact.First + " " + $contact.Last
        "Customer Phone is " + $contact.Phone
    }
```

### In PowerShell 5

In PowerShell 5 everything changes, and we finally got `class` and `enum` as language keywords for defining types.

```PowerShell
    class Contact
    {
        # Optionally, add attributes to prevent invalid values
        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()][string]$First
        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()][string]$Last
        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()][string]$Phone
    }
```

We could optionally add constructors and methods, etc., and we can create these with `New-Object` or by calling the constructor like `[Contact]::new()` or even by casting a hashtable:

```PowerShell
    $C = [Contact]@{
       First = "Joel"
       Last = "Bennett"
    }
```
