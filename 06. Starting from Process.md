# Starting From the `Process` Block

To write functions (or Cmdlets) that work well in the pipeline, we need to start by putting most of the work in the `process` block (or the `ProcessObject` method). Any reference to parameters which are set with `ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName` (or `ValueFromPipeline`), or variables which are set from those parameters, obviously _has_ to stay in the `process` block, but otherwise...

## Don't leave everthing in the process block

It's tempting to just write everything in the process block, because that pretty much guarantees that the command will work the same way regardless of how it's called (with parameters or on the pipeline).

However, you should always look over your code before you're ready to share it and consider whether you can move code to the `Begin` or `End` block -- anything you can do once instead of every time will improve the performance of your command when it's in the pipeline!

Some obvious examples include setup and teardown code which doesn't need to be re-run each time, and which doesn't use values from your pipeline parameters can obviously be moved, but in general: re-examine your use cases! Look for parameters which you anticipate passing only as parameters, and never as pipeline values (for example, consider `-Destination` on a `Move` command), and see if you're doing anything with _just those parameters_ that could be moved to the `begin` or `end` blocks.

Remember: you can't _safely_ refer to any parameter that's set as `ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName` or `ValueFromPipeline` in the `begin` or `end` blocks.
