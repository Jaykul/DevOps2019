# Output Types and Parameter names

For background:

- PowerShell is based on .NET, an object oriented framework
- Everything we output is an object
- Everything we pass as parameters are objects
- Each object is a specific `type` of object
- The definition of a specific type is called a `class`.

Objects are fundamental to the formatting of output in PowerShell, but also to the way pipeline input works. A parameter may be defined to take the whole pipeline object as a value, or it to take a single property from it which it matches the parameter type and name.

This means that designing a _set_ of commands that work together flawlessly is about more than just designing the parameters of the functions -- you should include designing the output types.

## What Type of Object?

In PowerShell we deal in three general categories of objects: the built-in objects which are part of the .NET framework, such as the FileInfo,  dynamic objects (i.e. "PSCustomObject") such as those created by PowerShell when you use `Select-Object`, and custom objects defined by the functions and

However, there are lots of very good reasons that you should define your own object types.

1. When you want to customize formatting, your output will need a type name
2. When you need to pass a lot of data between commands, you'll want a name for a parameter type
3. When you want interactive objects, you'll want a custom type

Most of the time, you can get away with just specifying a custom `PSTypeName` -- it's enough to let you format and even contrain inputs. However, it doesn't help users who are trying to tab-complete properties of your output objects, nor make it easy for users to create the objects to pass them as input.

## Why do we care about types?

Probably the best interaction between functions is to take the output of one command as input to another -- but the best user experience is not necessarily an `InputObject` parameter of the specific type, sometimes it's better to accept the properties of the object as parameters. For one thing, it means that a `PSObject` will give you enough structure for pipelining. For another, it allows users to just pass values for each parameter. one much easier for users who do _not_ have the object to call your function, while still preserving the ease of use
