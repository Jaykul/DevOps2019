# Getting parameter values from the pipeline

Hopefully, you've already encountered the `[Parameter()]` attribute, and it's many switches. Two of them allow you to collect the value of the parameter from pipeline input:

- ValueFromPipeline allows you to create an `$InputObject` parameter to collect each object. It's a good fit for when you only want to accept the output from one of your other functions, and when your objects are easy to construct (or have default constructors so you can easily build them from hashtables).

- ValueFromPipelineByPropertyValue allows you to collect the value of a single property from each object. Of course, you can set up multiple parameters like this to collect multiple properties. This is a good fit when you don't have a specific object in mind, or when you only need the key identifier from it (e.g. `PSPath` for files).

Now, the key thing to remember with pipeline input is that it means the `Process` part of your command is going to run over and over for each input. You can't always allow every parameter to be pipeline input -- and frequently, it doesn't make any sense to have every parameter passed in that way.

However, when you can support it, pipeline input gives users of a function much greater flexibility! For the sake of flexibility, I strongly recommend that you design your commands starting with a `Process` block, and let every parameter that can be assigned within that loop be a `ValueFromPipelineByPropertyValue` parameter. Remember that you can only have _one_ `ValueFromPipeline` parameter ...

There are a few caveats. First, when you design commands for pipeline input, think ahead about naming and aliases that could help someone bind the property from common objects or output of other commands in your module (as I talked about in the naming conventions). Second, make sure that you write some examples and plenty of test cases using the command that way, so that you actually cover the combinations of ways input can be passed during testing.
